## Prerequisites

We tested our code with Python 3.8.10 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.  Our code depends on the following modules.
* bm3d
* matplotlib
* numba
* numpy
* opencv_python
* scipy
* tqdm

Please browse [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) generated by [`pipreqs`](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/) to find the specific versions we used in our test environment, or you can simply do
```
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
in your (virtual) environment.

Alternatively, you can use [`sfsky.def`](sfsky.def) to build your [`singularity`](https://sylabs.io/) container by
```
$ singularity build --fakeroot ./sfsky.sif ./sfsky.def
INFO:    Starting build...
Getting image source signatures
(snip)
INFO:    Creating SIF file...
INFO:    Build complete: ./sfsky.sif
```
The file size of the generated container file (`sfsky.sif` in this example) will be around 560MB.

## Usage

Please open the following Jupyter notebooks in the `code/process/python_code/` directory.
* [`shape_from_sky.ipynb`](code/process/python_code/shape_from_sky.ipynb)
* [`shape_from_sky_spatially_varying.ipynb`](code/process/python_code/shape_from_sky_spatially_varying.ipynb)

In case you have built your singularity container as mentioned above, you can launch `jupyter` in `singularity` by
```
$ singularity exec ./sfsky.sif jupyter notebook --port 12345
    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:/// ...
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://localhost:12345/?token= ...
     or http://127.0.0.1:12345/?token= ...
```
